Package Control

Your system's locale is set to a value that can not handle non-ASCII characters. Package Control can not properly work unless this is fixed.

On Linux, please reference your distribution's docs for information on properly setting the LANG and LC_CTYPE environmental variables. As a temporary work-around, you can launch Sublime Text from the terminal with:

LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 sublime_text
